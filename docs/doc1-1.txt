General Motors will close its production plant in Oshawa along with four facilities in the US as part of a global reorganization that will see the company focus on electric and autonomous vehicle programs.

The auto manufacturer announced the closures Monday as part of a sweeping strategy to transform its product line and manufacturing process in order to meet changing demand in the transportation industry, a plan that it says will save the company $6 billion by the year 2020.

GM also said it will reduce salaried and salaried contract staff by 15 per cent, which includes 25 per cent fewer executives.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the closure, is "done" and there's nothing the government can do to change the automaker's plan.

He said he asked GM in a phone call on Sunday whether there was anything the province could do to keep the plant open, and was told it could not.

Ford said instead, the province will immediately bolster unemployment insurance and retraining measures to help the nearly 3,000 workers who will lose their jobs.

Dozens of workers were seen Monday walking out of the Oshawa Assembly Plant, with some saying they were very unhappy with news of the planned closure.

Unifor, the union representing more than 2,500 workers at the plant, said it has been told that there is no product allocated to the Oshawa plant past December 2019.

According to GM's website, the Oshawa Assembly Plant employs 2,522 workers with Unifor Local 222. Production began on Nov 7, 1953, and in the 1980s the plant employed roughly 23,000 people.

Earlier, Oshawa Mayor John Henry warned closing the plant would have ripple effects across Ontario and beyond.

"It's going to affect the province, it's going to affect the region," Henry said in an interview with the Canadian Press.  "The auto industry's been a big part of the province of Ontario for over 100 years."
