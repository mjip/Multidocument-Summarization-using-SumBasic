General Motors will close its production plant in Oshawa, Ont, along with four facilities in the US as part of a global reorganization that will see the company focus on electric and autonomous vehicle programs.

The auto manufacturer announced the closures as part of a sweeping strategy to transform its product line and manufacturing process in order to meet changing demand in the transportation industry, a plan that it says will save the company US$6 billion by the year 2020.

"This industry is changing very rapidly, when you look at all of the transformative technologies, be it propulsion, autonomous driving. These are things we're doing to strengthen the core business," GM chief executive and chairman Mary Barra told reporters on Monday. "We think it's appropriate to do it at a time, and get in front of it, while the company is strong and while the economy is strong."

GM also says it will reduce salaried and salaried contract staff by 15 per cent, which includes 25 per cent fewer executives.

The US $6-billion in savings includes cost reductions of US$4,5 billion and lower capital expenditure annually of almost US$1,5 billion, GM said.

This morning, dozens of workers were seen walking out of the Oshawa Assembly Plant, with some saying they were very unhappy with news of the planned closure.
